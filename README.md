The script can be run using the command line and typing: python thompson.py

Once the script has been run, the user will be prompted to press 1 to enter  their own data, 
or press 2 to run a series of precoded tests.

If the user chooses option 2, the script will run a large amount of tests, showing the function of the operators.

If the user chooses to input their own data, they will be prompted to enter the number of infix expressions they would like to create.
They will then be asked to input each expression one at a time

The user will then be asked how many strings they would like to check against the expressions, and will be required to 
input each string one at a time.

Once the user has finished entering all of their data, the script will convert the infix expressions to postfix expressions,
and will compare them to the strings that the user entered, and then show whether each string matches or fails to match each expression.
